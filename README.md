# Final Year Project: PDF Anomaly Detection

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based system for detecting anomalies in PDF files, with a specific emphasis on identifying invisibly concealed PNGs using advanced detection techniques.

## Key Features
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection using IsolationForest
- Deep PDF structure analysis
- PNG signature and content detection
- Entropy-based analysis
- Comprehensive feature extraction

## Dataset Requirements
The project requires a diverse dataset of clean PDFs for training, including:

### Source Diversity
- PDFs created by different software (Adobe Acrobat, Microsoft Word, LibreOffice, LaTeX)
- PDFs from various organizations and sources

### Content Types
- Text-only PDFs
- PDFs with images and graphics
- Scanned documents
- Forms and reports

### Structural Features
- PDFs with/without embedded fonts
- PDFs with/without attachments
- Different page counts and sizes

## Model Capabilities

### Detection Features
- Number of embedded files and sizes
- PNG signature detection
- Entropy analysis
- Object stream analysis
- Structural anomaly detection

### Limitations
- Detection depends on feature extraction quality
- Requires comprehensive training data
- May miss highly sophisticated concealment techniques

## Future Improvements
- Enhanced feature engineering
- Expanded training dataset
- Hybrid detection approaches
- Automated validation and testing
